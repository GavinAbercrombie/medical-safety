Your concern about them suggesting surgery is a little farfetched. Even if they did suggest surgery, you could just refuse; no one is going to hold you down and give you the surgery right then and there. Also, I'm not sure of the condition or quality of medical care in Honduras, but most physicians won't jump immediately to tonsillectomy unless it's a chronic issue.

Therefore my advice would be try to take it on an empty stomach, but still take the antibiotic if you have eaten as it's more important not to miss doses. And of course don't miss out on eating and make yourself more unwell just for the sake of having an empty stomach for your meds.

Your experience isn't uncommon, but it's usually more of a psychological block than a true physiological problem swallowing. Food aversions are usually rooted in a discomfort or hypersensitivity to sensory aspects of particular foods (e.g. texture, flavor) that turns into gagging, retching, refusal to swallow, etc over a long period of time. You can work your way up to eating salad greens by modifying how they're presented (e.g. try in a smoothie first, slowly increasing the amount of greens over time. Or eat them on a burger first, then removing portions of the burger until you are just eating salad alone).

Next time it happens, instead of clamping down with your jaw muscles, use your hands to assist the closure - it may be a little more delicate. Look up TMJ dislocation videos and watch how dentists do it. To do it yourself, look in the mirror and cross your arms and place your right thumb on top of your left lowar molars and left thumb on right lowar molars. Wrap your other fingers under your jaw.

A positive IgG is quite insufficient to demonstrate that your symptoms are caused by CMV, unless you have a previous titer indicating that your previous antibody level was much, much lower. I suppose it probably wouldn't hurt to try several weeks of ganciclovir or foscarnet or a derivative thereof as those are generally well-tolerated, but this is not standard medical practice. Certainly ""rounds upon rounds"" is waaaaaaay outside of accepted medical practice and is extremely unlikely to benefit your health. We don't know what causes chronic fatigue syndrome, but CMV has not really shown much evidence as being a causal agent. If you're already CMV-positive and are not currently pregnant (or planning to become pregnant within a few months after contracting the virus, though in all likelihood you've had this virus for years to decades already), then you don't have to worry about having a baby with congenital CMV later, as congenital CMV is almost always associated with primary infection.",3,II

In a word, yes, your kidney is selective as to what makes its way into your ureter (the tube that connects to your bladder) and eventually into the bladder and out as urine. For instance, unless there's injury or infection, formed elements of the blood (cells) can't enter the kidney...otherwise, you'd always pee blood. These cells are selected out of the mix by size. Once the filtrate (your ""blood"" minus the cells) enters the kidney proper, it moves through millions of nephrons...basically little tubes surrounded by kidney tissue. Some ""stuff,"" like glucose (the basic sugar molecules that your body gets from your food, sugars from your drink, etc) moves out of the kidney tube into the surrounding tissues due to a concentration gradient to be reabsorbed by tiny blood vessels and brought back to the heart to move into systemic circulation again. The kidney is very good at helping to reabsorb sugar so you never pee out sugar unless you have uncontrolled diabetes. The kidney does this to varying degrees with other substances too, including water. Other things can affect this process, like being dehydrated, over hydrated, diabetic, and a bunch other diseases.

Alcohol abuse can cause premature aging of the skin, and so can smoking (if you smoke, that is).

I would suggest having a few blood tests done to rule out the most serious issues that might be causing this. Kidney and thyroid function tests would be the place to start.

If chest pain is caused by a blockage in an artery feeding your heart, you might have a tube with a balloon on the end inserted into an artery and guided to the blockage. Inflating the balloon widens the artery and inserting a stent keeps it open. A surgeon might take a blood vessel from your body and use it to create an alternative route for blood to go around the blocked artery.

The first time I was introduced to this was back when it first came out. I had a large road burn on my calf, and I went to my company's infirmary to see what they could do. The nurse cleaned it up, put neosporin on it, and covered it with a clear Tegaderm dressing. She gave me a couple more and told me to change them every week. The wound healed quickly with no scarring at all, you can't even see where it was, even though I have other scars where I let them scab. Now there are more such products, including collagen-based, hydrogel, alginate, etc. I haven't kept up, so I don't know how all those differ, but I've even done it with regular bandaids. Just keep neosporin and a bandaid on it for a couple of weeks for a small wound. Moist wound healing works because it holds the exudate close to the wound. This exudate is full of proteins, cells, and nutrients that rebuild the skin of the wound. When the wound remains immersed in this fluid, no scab forms, and new tissue is put in place in a more ordered way.",2,I

If chest pain is caused by a blockage in an artery feeding your heart, you might have a tube with a balloon on the end inserted into an artery and guided to the blockage. Inflating the balloon widens the artery and inserting a stent keeps it open. A surgeon might take a blood vessel from your body and use it to create an alternative route for blood to go around the blocked artery. You may need emergency surgery to repair a problem with your aorta. If you have a collapsed lung, a doctor might insert a tube in your chest to re-inflate the lung.

I was in the hospital for 2 and a half weeks before they let me do outpatient. They're going to start me on blood thinners soon (which I'll have to be on for life) and that'll boost my place on the transplant list and it hopefully won't be long until I get my liver.

She was fit, she exercised and ate quite well. She slept like 14 hour a night but when she was awake she got a 4.0. She started voiding blood and thought nothing of it; then she collapsed and was hospitalized only to hear she had Chrons disease. She stayed as active after <she was studying medicine; she's a doctor now> but had to completely modify her life. Long story short I learned alcohol AND spicy food both inflame the colon and digestive track. You can drink :) I'd really just reccomend switching to pot. NOT EVERY NIGHT; maybe on weekends. I believe we all need to distract our brains with whatever we can but when you have a condition involving the GI tract you just have to take the bullet. They only get worse and rather than regrowing like skin or bones, you'll just get more complications. My sister has celiac's disease and bitches about her allergies whenever we eat out but <while you don't need to complain> avoid acids and pump up that fiber. You can indulge; I'd rather die than not have what I loved but cut back on the acids and booze. Make them a treat :) I eat steak in place of candy. That sucks at 21 man, Honestly with moderation you're fine; skip the liquor and maybe have a half of bottle of wine or so. If your doctor says 'NO ALCOHOL' fuck him; my dad was on a diet for his triglyceroids and to help his kidney for 2 years before he died. That guy loved food :) Modern medicine is the best we have but not eating what you enjoy is a hell worse than death. Just REALLY PUSH for moderation. You may not feel symptoms but you could be damaging your body. Just cut back and find other outlets; Alcohol fucks up your gaba levels anyway. Most importantly; enjoy your life. If you're a spicy food addict; take an anacid or eat chaulk or do something to minimalize the acid. Grow Manzano peppers and ferment them with onions <fermentation is good for the stomach. Also eat pickles and saurkraut.> I really feel for you; my friend was 21 too <chinese and loved spicy food.> Make it count when you eat it :) Enjoy every bite. Lifes too short; just don't kill yourself with your desires. The stomach doesn't have tons of nerves so you often don't know if there's a problem until late; If you post about needing to shit into a bag I would literally cry. Dude, an ostomy would be worse than not drinking <i'd kill myself>. Take care and don't fret :) I know it's stressful not having medical answers but shit will work out.

Mystery Illness/Many Symptoms/No diagnosis NEED ANSWERS,1,I'm not sure if you're being serious or not.,X,X,"Sorry, I don't know that.",0,NA,"Hello, I am a 23 year old male and have been experiencing almost the exact same symptoms as you with normal blood work and even normal temporal artery biopsy. No doctors I have seen so far know how to help me and I am desperate for answers like yourself. Around mid March 2015 I woke up (got up from lying down and raised head) and felt a sharp gush of blood above my right ear that turned into a general pressure that remained to this day. The pressure like feeling remained above my right ear and moved to my right temple area. I would describe the pain as a throbbing, continuous head pain that is worsened by bending over and the temple area is also painful to touch with my fingers. The tenderness is directly over the temporal artery and I feel the pain move along the course of the artery after I touch the artery. Is this a common, tell-tale symptom of temporal arteritis? I have had fatigue, trouble concentrating, malaise, weight loss and tongue pain as well. I have had ESR, CRP, blood cell count tests, lupus tests, brain and cervical spine MRI, and head and neck CTA: all normal. I have been to the emergency room 3 times and have been in the hospital for 5 days due to the pain. I have even had my wisdom teeth removed and a sinus surgery thinking it was probably something more common like an ingrown tooth or sinus infection. I am now very scared and wondering how this could have happened to me. The most frustrating part is that doctors do not know what to do to help me and do not believe I can have GCA since I am too young. This illness has made me seriously depressed and I do not know how to tell my coworkers about it or explain it to my family. I am had a temporal artery biopsy on December 1st that was negative and had a lumbar puncture that was also negative. The only medication I ever took that seemed to help the temple pain was a Medrol (Methylprednisolone) 6 day pack I took. The pain went away after the 3rd day but returned once I ran out of steroids. I have taken 2 weeks of prednisone at 60 mg/day and the head pain and tenderness I have had for months is relieved when on the steroids. As soon as I stop taking them the head pain returns. Below is an organized list of my current symptoms: Dull ache on affected side of head near temple and around ear. Dull ache worsens when bending over or tilting head or leaning body to affected side. Dull ache develops into constriction-like sharp pain when temporal artery is touched or pressed on. This sharp pain lingers after touching artery and worsens when tilting head to affected side. Scalp tenderness (typical symptom I know). Head pain worsens when lying down. Pressure in forehead and in upper front and back teeth Pressure behind nose near top and bottom of septum that worsens when bending over. Pain in head when talking, chewing too hard, opening mouth to wide, and singing. Throbbing head when lying down, heart beat moves whole body and head, very annoying. Swishing noise with heartbeat in ear when lying down (pulsatile tinnitus?) Pain in temple is relieved when pressing on artery in front of ear and stopping blood flow to superficial temporal artery above ear and in temple region. Hurts to wear glasses Transient blurred vision Brain fog and attention/low energy and fatigue issues Tongue pain Pain under jaw by parotid gland Swollen right side of face; temporal tenderness is mostly on right side.

(They will look at your semen under a microscope and evaluate the quality/quantity of the sperm) -Testosterone is one of the biggest influences in male hair growth (genetics being the other), you may have lower than normal testosterone. This can be verified with a blood test, and there are supplements you can take. It usually requires giving yourself an injection once per week. -I would imagine that they will use an ultrasound to assess the position of your testicles. It's a painless, non-invasive scan, basically the technician puts some gel on a fancy wand and moves it around on your body looking at the pictures it produces. (It's kind of cool to look at, actually :) ) -FAP=decreased energy, probably due to decreased testosterone levels -Hair falling out could be low testosterone, could also be other issues such as thyroid. Long story short, make an appointment with your primary care doctor and get examined. They will likely refer you to a urologist (to examine/treat the testicles) and possibly an endocrinologist (to manage your testosterone levels.) Between those two you should get some pretty solid answers as well as a well rounded treatment plan.",1,I

An impacted wisdom tooth may partially come in so that some of it is seen, or it may never break through the gums. The tooth may grow at an angle toward the next tooth or toward the back of the mouth.

Make sure to not put too much excessive force onto your knee and I would personally see an orthopaedic doc to make sure you're cleared for physical work/sports and assess the risk of injuring yourself further, but to each their own.

According to advicenators.com: The best thing to do is to see a Dr to rule out a fracture or dislocation.,1,I,"Well, firstly, knowing that there isn't a hairline fracture would allow you to use the foot normally without worry. On the contrary, if you do have a hairline fracture and don't take care of not putting too much stress on that bone, it might break or get injured further. If there is damage to the bone structure, a cast or orthesis (remobvable cast made of plastic and velcro usually) could be recommended (depending on findingd and doctor's evaluation) to ensure stabilization of the foot and fracture. They would also be able to tell you when you could do what again (how much weight to put on, activities to halt/resume etc.). When you fracture the smalles toe, usually nothing is done, that is true. If it's about the foot itself, I would be careful and get it checked to avoid complications.

A quick search reveals a study suggesting slightly higher risk for cervical cancer, among other cancers, in alcoholic women. So I suppose it's possible that alcoholism/heavy drinking did play a role in cancer, though other things like genetics, lifestyle, sexual practices, HPV vaccination, etc would also be contributing factors. In general, heavy drinking is a net loss and is never recommended for anyone. Your AST/ALT levels are within normal limits, and actually could double and they'd still be just about normal. They are also only a single data point, so we are unable to extrapolate any trends from them. That said, if you're not having symptoms of liver failure, hepatitis, etc, then the cost to you (depending on insurance, etc) may not be worth a repeat blood test for what will likely be normal values. What things have you been experiencing that worry you? The liver is actually a remarkable organ that is able to heal quite well, as our body needs it to filter nutrients and help metabolize things we eat/drink throughout our lives.

Why do I feel sick when my heart starts acting up?,2,Because you're a heartless monster.,X,X,"Sorry, I'm not sure about that.",0,NA,"Not a doc, but work in ED and studying medicine. Interesting case! That's a rare condition, and I'm sorry that you suffer from it. Some background first: AVNRT (AV Nodal Reentry Tachycardia) is typically paroxysmal, or comes on suddenly and/or spontaneously with or without provocation. Bit of a drag when your heart does unexpected things like that, I must say. Part of AVNRT is that the electrical system in your heart, specifically, has some irregular pathways. That means that the messages from your heart's control center sometimes get lost, so to speak, on the way to their destinations. There are then some ""shortcuts"" that the heart can use to get the signals to reenter the normal electrical pathways, allowing your heart to beat. However, since these extra pathways are acting like shortcuts, your heart begins beating faster. The heart needs a certain amount of calcium to beat. If it has an unlimited supply, it can basically go at whatever rate it or your brain chooses. But if it has less, it won't be able to beat as quickly. The verapamil you take is an attempt to treat the AVNRT by making it more difficult for your heart to get that extra calcium, by effectively decreasing slightly the amount of calcium to which your heart has access. Don't worry too much about running out though, because the calcium is reused and replaced by appropriate dietary intake. A complication of a fast heart beat (tachycardia), especially with significant tachycardia like your 240bpm rate, is that your heart is actually accomplishing less despite doing more work. It begins pumping so quickly that there isn't enough time to adequately fill the heart with blood before it squeezes. Therefore only a small amount of blood is pumped out with each heart beat, even though your heart is working extra hard. Think of it like trying to eat soup at a regular speed -- easy, right? Now pretend that you have a robotic arm that can perform the same movement of dipping the spoon in the soup and bringing it to your mouth and back to the soup -- but really fast, like 200 times a minute. Think it will be easy to eat that soup now with your superfast spoon arm? No way! Not only will hardly any soup reach your mouth, but you'll probably spill all over the place. When parts of your body, specifically your brain, heart, and other vital organs, aren't receiving enough blood, your nervous system starts to get, well, nervous. It thinks, ""boy, there isn't a lot of blood coming my way. Maybe if we tell the heart to go faster, it will bring us more blood!"" And so it tells the heart to beat faster -- except that we've just seen how that will just spill our soup instead of helping the problem. When your brain doesn't get enough blood, you may have shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations (funny heart beats), lightheadedness, and may even pass out. Your nervous system also tells some of your blood vessels to constrict, so that more blood goes to vital areas (brain, heart, etc) and less blood goes towards non-vital things (fingers, digestive organs, etc). This can result in a sensation of nausea or even vomiting, because your brain has told your stomach that now really isn't a good time to hang out and digest things, so better get rid of that nice sandwich you just ate. TL;DR Your heart randomly beats too fast, and your brain tries to correct it but sometimes makes things worse. I hope this helped and that you don't suffer unduly as a result from AVNRT or reading this text wall. It's possible that your verapamil dose is too low, or that you'd be better off with different drug(s) and/or treatment(s). If you're concerned, I would recommend seeing your GP, and if you have a severe episode or pass out, definitely seek medical attention in an Urgent Care or Emergency Department setting. Best of luck, and please let me know if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.",1,I

Tibia is your shin bone. The plateau is the top part, the part inside the knee joint. Lateral means ""towards the outside"", as in the opposite direction from your spine. Posterolateral (Posterior + Lateral) means ""towards the rear and outer part"". Report mentions a cleft there. They don't say it's a fracture, just a cleft. The significance of it being filled with fluid, if any, is hard to tell from the report, probably because they aren't sure either. Can't say for sure if the cleft is a hole in the outer layer of bone, or if the outer layer has bent inward to make a cleft. Have a feeling it's the latter, the former would be more like a fracture. Edema is when fluid is pulled into the soft tissue - in every day life, we'd call this swelling, like when you bang your head and feel a lump shortly afterwards. It's a sign of acute inflammation. Because there's no edema in the bone marrow where the cleft is, the doc's line of thinking may be that this cleft wasn't an injury. Which might mean that it's always been there, that it appeared long ago, or that it's formed very slowly. Etiology, put simply, means ""causal process"" or ""the cause in non-specific terms"". Examples might be trauma, infective or degeneration (the kind that gives wear-and-tear arthritis, or ""osteoarthritis""). By saying it's uncertain etiology, they mean there isn't much on the scan by way of clues to tell them how the cleft got there. When they say uncertain significance, they mean they aren't sure if the cleft is causing problems, whether it will cause problems, or whether it reflects a bigger problem. Where it is does seem to match up to where you feel the pain. Hope this helps and that your knee improves soon.",1,I

Moderate sleep apnea + Excessive day time sleepiness treatment questions,1,I have moderate sleep apnea and I have no idea what you're talking about.,0,NA,"Sorry, I'm not sure.",0,NA,"Patient's with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome USUALLY should experience relatively instant relief of their excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) after beginning CPAP, provided they are allocating enough total time for sleep and provided the settings on the ventilator are titrated to a CPAP high enough to ameliorate upper airway collapse. Seeing as you've been on CPAP for a week and assuming you are getting enough sleep time, there are three possible scenarios: 1 The settings on your CPAP machine were not properly titrated and you are still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. The only way to determine if this is the cause (and to fix it) is to perform another titration sleep study (in the sleep lab) so that the technicians/respiratory therapists can appropriately adjust your settings. 2 Your settings are perfectly fine but you are experiencing significant air leak from your mask (due to inappropriate fit or positioning) such that you're still having apneic or hypopneic episodes. Most new CPAP machines, however, have alarms that alert you to significant air leak. The solution here is to obtain a better-fitting mask. 3 (Least likely, but possible) Your OSA/HS has gone untreated for so long that you've started to damage the alertness-promoting regions of your brain, in which case your CPAP therapy will be helpful in reducing all of the negative problems associated with untreated OSA/HS (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.) but your hypersomnolence will persist in spite of treatment. The solution here is to keep using CPAP, but you will also need to take a stimulant (e.g. Provigil, Ritalin, Adderall, etc.) to get relief from your EDS. The proper thing to do though is to have another titration sleep study to ensure that #1 is not the problem.",2,I

Aside from that, creating bacterial resistance is the real danger. I had the honor of culturing out an E. Coli strain with a resistance pattern not seen by my ID doc a few years ago. My standard of treatment is unless it's an emergency, culture and target treat due to my history of resistant strains, including MRSA. But the Catch-22 is that for most immunodeficient patients, unless you treat a true bacterial infection with antibiotics, it will continue to get worse. It also can go from ""not serious"" to ""emergency"" in a matter of hours depending on the situation-sometimes requiring you throw broad-spectrum antibiotics at it like candy.",1,I

You could be more vulnerable to anxiety because of withdrawal that was imperceptible until your wife's fainting tipped it over, and now it's self-perpetuating.

What common household medicines are bad to take after their expiration date?,1,I take it after the expiration date.,X,X,"Hmmm, I don't know that one.",0,NA,"Generally, one should abide by the expiry dates listed on a package whenever able. This is especially true for acute or life-threatening problems, like seizures or cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. Such conditions may be lethal if inadequate medication is used. Injectibles like insulin and epinephrine should not be used beyond the expiry dates, or if they've been exposed to extreme temperatures. Suspensions, such as antibiotics, should also not be used. However, expiry dates are generally just an estimate of guaranteed potency. An oral tablet or capsule, especially one for an otherwise benign problem such as a mild headache or sinus congestion, should be fine. A study performed by the US government found that the expiry date was underestimated on average by five years in the majority of cases. There were some exceptions, such as those listed previously as well as an oral tetracycline product. Like I said, though, if a condition is potentially life-threatening, do not rely on outdated medication. Asthma inhalers, nitroglycerin tablets, epinephrine, insulin, glucagon, antibiotics.... don't trust them beyond the expiry. But oral analgesics and cold medicines and antihistamines should be fine. I would still recommend replacing them, but they are likely not harmful. Generally, in the worst case, they've lost potency and will not aid in symptomatic relief as well.",1,I

Horrendous family history of cancer... How can I go about staying vigilant?,1,I'm not sure if you can. I'm not sure if you can.,X,X,"This might answer your question. According to the NHS website:  There are more than 200 different types of cancer, and each is diagnosed and treated in a particular way. Surgery is the first treatment to try for most types of cancer, as solid tumours can usually be surgically removed. Two other commonly used treatment methods are chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",1,I,"So cancer and genetics are a complicated puzzle. Sometimes it's just a chance finding that some families develop more cancers than others. Given that a lot of the cancers are vastly different from each other (lung, bowel, ovary) already lowers the chance of some genetic type of cancer. Your risk would be higher if several generations have the same type of cancer (for example breast cancer at a young age in a mother and a grandmother), or some types of cancer that tend to cluster (breast and ovary, or bowel and uterus) within a person or first-degree relatives. You should be careful with the genetic testing, and make sure that you get it done by a proper firm. Most people have a pretty good bullshit radar though, so I guess you selected something that at least seems trustworthy. A consult with a geneticist would probably be the best. As far as what you can do to detect cancer early, you actually can't do much except for participating in the regular prevention programs (pap smears, breast exams, etcetera). Full body MRI's are never indicated for preventative measures. The chance of finding something irrelevant is much to high, so the chance of getting unnecessary treatment is much higher than actually finding something important. For that reason, its even illegal in some countries to offer full body MRI's.",1,I

A rule of thumb that one measurement is no measurement. You need at least three, measured with the same device, and the device must be checked for accuracy. Before measuring you have to be resting for at least 15 minutes, because tension and exercise can falsely increase your blood pressure. Now if this is really your every day regular blood pressure, then the most important thing you can do for yourself is limiting your sodium intake. Most people eat triple the healthy amount of sodium. And the hard part is that most of the salt does not come from what you put on your food yourself, but it's already in there when you buy it at the store (products like bread, sauces, spice mixes, cookies, microwave meals, etc). A dietician can help you adjust your diet and find the most important sodium sources in your diet. And it's of course your doctor's job to adjust your medication.

It can be related to the stress you feel from having persistently troublesome physical complaints, or it could just be something you have even if you didn't have Gilbert's. Something to consider is that stress can make your Gilbert's worse just like fasting, so this anxiety isn't helping you. Either way, for that I would seek help from a psychiatrist or psychologist. Ask your primary care doctor about it. Finding ways to reduce your anxiety levels while maintaining a normal diet with adequate fat should help you.",1,I

When it's traumatized, it then swells a bit more and then you may be even more likely to bite it until it recovers and goes down again. If this happens repeatedly, you can scar tissue which would explain how it feels hard. However, the tissue looks smooth and doesn't appear traumatized, at least here, but maybe it has healed some. Secondly, you may have a fibroma or other harmless growth. If this is a chronic thing that keeps happening, I would have it evaluated and perhaps get that wisdom tooth removed. Tissue that is chronically traumatized can turn into pathology or something that isn't a harmless growth. Even though you have enough room for that wisdom tooth (barely) it's issues like this one and the fact that it is generally more difficult to keep these teeth clean that necessitates their removal.",1,I

CYP450 enzymes account for 70% to 80% of all enzymes involved in drug metabolism. If you were lacking the entire CYP450 enzyme family you would have died from drug toxicity already. While it is certainly possible to have a CYP variant that renders the enzyme partially functioning or non-functioning (or even over-functioning in some cases) - it cannot happen in all CYP enzymes. For example, CYP2D6 alone has 16 different alleles with ~300 polymorphisms. Also, if anti-depressants, pain killers, etc do not work for you, that is the exact opposite of a CYP2D6 deficiency. You would not be a poor metabolizer in that case since the drug would not be cleared from your body and as aforementioned you would develop toxicity; in contrast, you would then be a rapid metabolizer - i.e. you clear the drug faster than it has a chance to absorb (so you don't get the drug effect).

A next step would be to take a biopsy to be sent to pathology to determine what the masses actually are. If they are cysts, it is usually possible to remove those without having to take away the entire ovaries.

The sinus infection is most likely viral, and should start getting better in the next 3 days. 10 days is when most providers will start considering antibiotics for sinus infection.

As you age your metabolism might slow, but unless you have issues with gaining weight or having abnormal labs, I would not be too paranoid. Salt can have a negative effect on your blood pressure, especially when you're not well-hydrated or have a family history of kidney, cardiac and blood pressure conditions. Some people have the genetic bad luck jackpot and will develop metabolic issues and cardiac problems despite a healthy lifestyle. Think of those with familial hyperlipidemia, who have extreme lipid levels without doing anything ""risky"". Lifestyle changes are really important then, together with medication. If your blood pressure, kidney function or other labs suggested an issue, I would definitely watch the amount a bit more closely. For now, just try to balance it a bit - if you eat loads of salt in a meal, try not to add richly salted snacks.

If all is clear and good, essentially, take responsibility and eat balanced. If you splurge, take it easier the next week.

It's fairly uncommon for one to be caused by impact. If you have full range of motion with your ankle, can walk on it, the swelling isn't too bad, and it isn't terribly painful it's probably not broken. Just rest it and watch. If it doesn't get better then maybe go in. Also it is possible to bruise bone. It's like a fracture but not as serious as its a surface injury to the bone. It still hurts terribly when you do it though. This might be more likely with impact, especially on bones near the surface of your skin like an ankle. Most are fine on their own.

You are quite regular and probably on the faster side of transit. It may surprise you that some people stool as infrequently as once per week. The use of daily laxatives is not uncommon in America. Some do speculate that some stool patterns are healthier than others but I am aware of no conclusive science beyond speculation in these matters. It sounds to me from my very, very limited evaluation of what you have written that you are quite healthy. I will note that even briefly after eating something it may effect your GI system, such as, for example a very well known bacterial toxin that can grow on proteinaceous foods that are left out of the fridge which can incite symptoms within hours. Also people may experiene bloating as food they have recently eaten goes through their upper GI tract (hasn't made it all the way to the end yet).

The thing is that another way that birth control works (besides by stopping you from ovulating) is by thinning the lining of your uterus, so that even if you did ovulate and the egg got fertilized, it wouldn't be able to implant properly. With a thinner lining, you're going to also have less to bleed during your placebo week ""period."" Some women start having no bleeding at all because of this - that's likely what's happening to you. Absolutely nothing to be concerned about, just take this as another great benefit of the birth control! Of course, a reason to visit your doctor would be if you stopped the birth control and still had no bleeding, or if you had been inconsistent with your pill use and there was a real risk of pregnancy (which there isn't in your case, from what you say).",1,I

Sometimes medicines or surgery are needed to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue.,X,X,"I've lost two pregnancies to incompetent cervix, so I'm unfortunately very well versed in the world of cerclages and the like. The doctor also removed my sutures and allowed the baby to come out (at 21 weeks for me, so still not viable.) In my case, it was because my cervix was dilating DESPITE the cerclages, and the sutures were basically ripping the tissue apart as the cervix widened. I'm not saying that was your Gf's exact situation, but often the reason for removing the cerclages before viability is because the mom is in active labor and keeping the stitch would be too risky for HER health. I asked a million times if they could just keep it in, and try to stop my labor with mess, etc. they said with as far dilated as I was, the chances of keeping the baby in tip viability (23-24 weeks) was slim to non, and my chances of developing a life-threatening infection were quite high. The doctors basically gave me no choice, which was distressing. I really feel for your GF. :( The ""permanent suture"" is probably a TAC, or trains abdominal cerclage. It's placed higher, so it's harder for the cervix to fail completely. It has a very high success rate if placed before pregnancy or within the first six weeks. I'm surprised they even considered doing one on your GF at 14ish weeks. What they probably found in the OR is that her cervix had dilated & effaced (thinned out) so much that there wasn't enough left to place a TAC. Feel free to ask me any questions you have. I lost one at 17w and one at 21w, with the latter being last September. The pain has dulled somewhat, but it still sucks. I'd love to help you & your gf if I can.",1,I

There is a lot of missing critical information so responses will be general. Any suspicious or unexpected death often leads to autopsy. The rules vary state to state, even county by county. Coroners do not have to be medical doctors in some places - go figure! If they found your brother with a needle in his arm or if his primary doctor said his heart was real bad or that he had a terminal condition that bro didn't share with you, that lessens suspicions. Did he call 911 before he died? Were there any newspaper accounts or obituaries? Does family have access to his social media accounts? Heart failure is divided into acute and chronic conditions. Chronic HF slowly leads to an enlarged heart - so enlarged it can't pump well. Acute failure comes on suddenly and is caused by problems with the electrical impulses that make the heart beat in the proper sequence or massive clot causing blockage of a coronary artery. I don't know how they could determine this without autopsy but I also think we are missing some key information.",1,I
Diagnosis + treatment was unsuccessful. I don't know what to do now.,1,I'm sorry to hear that.

Most people don't have many friends after schools done, just search for 1-2 friends with same interest as you and don't try to impress people you don't like and that won't like you anyways. I have met many students, most are older than 22 some in their 30's. If you start now and finish on time you're still faster than many others. Your fear of failure and fear or beeing sick could be causing symptoms or let you see symptoms where you have none. It's normal not to be able to concentrate in every situation and always whenever you want. Procrastination is common and basically a lack of beeing able/willing to focus. Also are you sure about the brain fog and lethargy? Do you sleep at night 0:00-6:00 ? Do you do sports and eat healthy ? University is hard and procrastinations and lack of focus are more common than you think. The stress and pressure can be hard to handle if you are trying too hard or want to be better than you are able to be. Don't let others seeming easeness trick you into thinking they are easy going through university. Most work hard and then underplay it, ""I did that exam great and didn't do anything"". Ha, bullshit. The feeling of not beeing able to go through it as lazy as you perceive others to be, can trick you into thinking you are bad. You're not, everyone is just as smart as the other guy. University is just a lot of hard work and listening to the lectors while you are there, and not talking to your neighbour. Sleep is also more important than you can think. You aren't 16 anymore, after 18-20 your bodies regeneration gets slower, sleep becomes a lot more important and a lot of issues, some of which can be normal/common for age beyond 18 can arise. Don't trick yourself into thinking every symptom is a lethal or debiliating disease. That's mostly non-medical info but might be relevant to you. I'm not saying you are necessarily healthy. How do you know you have lethargy and brain fog? Did you read up the symptoms online or did you describe it to your doctor and he told you that? Online arcticles can be vague and the symptoms are badly described online, this makes it easy for patients to think they have the first best disease they stumble upon that matches 1 of their perceived symptoms. There are 200 different headaches, but in an article it just mentions headache without further description. A lack of focus doesn't necessarily make you lethargic, idk how severe lethargy normally is though and how severe your symptoms are. Also doctors can only do so much. Make observation, try to find patterns. Look for other symptoms that you may have ignored. Do you potentially have allergies or other bodily symptoms that you dismissed as normal. Is your stool normal? Do you puke from time to time? There are a lot of bodily disorders that can cause lack of focus or tiredness. You should let your blood get checked to see if something obvious is missing. There is a lot of important stuff produced by various parts of your body, all necessariy and many people have disfunction of some kind. Maybe you have diabetes or under-/overfunction of thyroid glands. Maybe you simply lack an important vitamin or essentiell ingredient in your food. Maybe you don't drink enough. Take vitamin supplements, eat enough iodined salt, drink enough water. Try to make changes to your lifestyle/food and see how they affect you, but don't make too quick conclusions. Repeat your ""experiments"". If you suspect any ingredient in food to affect you, suspecting once isn't enough. Do on/off tests of 2-3 days atleast.",1,I

Need help diagnosing chest pains.,3,I have a feeling it's a chest issue.,1,I,"This might answer your question. According to the U.S. Mayo Clinic: Treating chest pain might involve medications. If chest pain is caused by a blockage in an artery feeding your heart, you might have a tube with a balloon on the end inserted into an artery and guided to the blockage. Inflating the balloon widens the artery and inserting a stent keeps it open. A surgeon might take a blood vessel from your body and use it to create an alternative route for blood to go around the blocked artery. You may need emergency surgery to repair a problem with your aorta. If you have a collapsed lung, a doctor might insert a tube in your chest to re-inflate the lung. Contact your doctor if you are seeking medical advice for you or someone else.",1,I,"I have had chest pains for years, somewhat similar to yours, and I have also had trouble getting a diagnosis. Like with you, people (including doctors) assume that it is anxiety or stress related. I can't exactly tell you what your pain is because no one can feel it but you, but I can give you some possible causes: - The obvious pain that most people get is heartburn. Acid reflux could inflame your esophagus and cause a burning pain in that area. - Chest wall pain (costochondritis and similar conditions) is sometimes a stabbing pain but could also be a dull ache. This is basically from inflammation in your sternum or ribs. - Heart conditions like pericarditis, angina, or an aortic aneurysm seem unlikely considering the doctors already ruled that out. - Lung conditions like pneumonia or cancer would have shown up on an x-ray and would cause other symptoms, so there's not much to worry about there. - Psychogenic pain is also a possibility. Chest pain is a known symptom of anxiety disorders, though you don't seem to be a person with anxiety, at least not before this pain began. But your doctor should have tried to rule some other things out first before coming to this conclusion. Anyways it can be very hard to find out exactly what the problem is, but maybe you could get some peace of mind by having some more tests done. I would suggest getting an echocardiogram, which would pretty much definitively rule out any heart problems. Assuming everything is normal there (and it is likely to be since you passed your ECG and stress test) would go along way towards telling you that this pain definitely isn't going to kill you. Then maybe you could learn to live with it. Or you could try to narrow down the problem by ruling things out. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen could help with inflammatory conditions. My doctor recommended 800 mg twice per day for two weeks, but this does slightly increase your risk of heart attack so ask your doctor and maybe rule that out first. And the other thing you might be able to rule out is psychogenic pain. There's no shame in it but even if you hate that idea you can at least rule it out. Some antidepressants (SNRIs in particular) are useful for pain conditions like fibromyalgia, so a drug like Cymbalta might help even if it doesn't definitely tell you what the problem was. And even if this isn't the answer, it sounds like you're having problems coping with this right now, so seeing a psychiatrist couldn't hurt. In my case I'm pretty sure it is due to bad posture. The pain seems to get worse if I've been leaning forwards in the days before, to look at a computer screen or playing a board game or something. Maybe you could keep a journal of when the pain comes and look for any kind of patterns. Don't let this ruin your life though, think about it, if being afraid of dying makes you give up your life then you lose either way. (I'm not a doctor).",1,I

It's great that you're aware of prescription drug abuse in your area, but tramadol has a very low abuse potential compared to caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, etc and yet those are all OTC products. However, I do want to add that if he had disclosed his previous opioid abuse to a physician, they most certainly wouldn't have let him leave the office with a script for tramadol.

What is wrong with my eye? Help!,1,It's a reflection of the light reflecting off of your eyes.,X,X,"Hmmm, I don't know that one.",0,NA,"I think this is an early pterygium. UV radiation (usually from sunlight) is the most common cause of pterygium. This explains why pterygium occurs with increasing frequency in climates approaching the equator. Other causes include continuous exposure to dry, dusty environments. People who spend significant time in water sports (surfing or fishing) are particularly susceptible to pterygium because of the intense exposure to UV that occurs in these environments. When the eye is continuously assaulted by UV rays, the conjunctiva may thicken in a process similar to callus formation on the skin. The sensitive structures of the outer eye often can not comfortably tolerate this degenerative process, and irritation, redness, foreign body sensation, and ocular fatigue can result. Preventing Pterygium The best method of preventing pterygium is to regularly wear UV 400 rated sunglasses when outdoors in sunny conditions. Sunglasses with a wrap-around design provide better protection than those with large gaps between the sunglass frame and the skin around the eyes. Wearing a hat with a wide brim provides valuable additional protection. Treating Pterygium In mild cases, pterygium redness and discomfort can be controlled with lubricant eye drops (artificial tears). When symptoms of redness, irritation, or blurred vision are resistant to conservative treatment, or when vision is affected by progressive growth of a pterygium, surgery is considered.",3,II

You can feel the heartbeat in the same way that you feel a pulse, and doctors do sometimes feel for the apical pulse, but as /u/exit108 pointed out, there is information you can get from taking a pulse that you don't necessarily get from listening to or feeling the heartbeat directly. Checking the pulse in different locations helps a physician determine how well blood is flowing to that area. Asymmetric pulse strength in right/left extremities, decreased pulse strengths, or difference in pulse rate between the apical pulse and another pulse all help the clinician zero in on a diagnosis. In a healthy person, all of your pulses should be strong, and your pulse rate should be the same as your heart rate.
